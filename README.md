# Virtual-Bidding-NYSIO-market


In this project, I implemented a simple virtual trading strategy in New York ISO's electricity markets. The goal was to maximize profits. I trained the model on price data from one year, and implemented the strategy on the data from the next year. I experimented with a Multi-Layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression to see which one performed better. I also experimented with different quantiles and different budgets.

Logistic Regression with a quantile of 0.70 and budget of $300,000 yielded a profit of $3,560,564.
